# Bigdata research and sharing

## What we do

First of all, some topics are proposed and chosen at the beginning of each month. And then each topic is assigned to one or more team members. After that, some documents, videos, codes and so on are found by us. Subsequently, those informations are summarised into documents and reports. At the end of month, presentations about the research are given.

Have fun !
